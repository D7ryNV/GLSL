= GLSL

This repository contains source for the GLSL Specification, and is a staging
area for Khronos-private GLSL extensions, before they go public in
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL.

It is notably for Vulkan related GLSL extensions, but technically for those
that do not live in the Khronos registries for OpenGL or OpenGL ES.

== Differences from GitHub

  * This is a partial mirror of https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL, and
    additionally contains GLSL spec source that is not yet published.
  * The README is notably different, and this one won't maintain an index of
    extensions (unlike the GitHub README).
  * Once something moves to GitHub, the GitHub version will be considered
    the true source of the extension.

== This Project Contains

  * new shading language extension proposals and discussions
  * issue tracking for these unreleased extensions
