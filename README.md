# GLSL

This repository is for staging Khronos-private GLSL extensions,
before they go public in https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL.

It is notably for Vulkan related GLSL extensions,
but technically for those that do not live in the Khronos registries for OpenGL or OpenGL ES.

## Differences from GitHub

- This is a partial mirror of the GitHub https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL.
- The README.md are notably different, and this one won't maintain an index of extensions (unlike the GitHub README).
- Once something moves to GitHub, the GitHub version will be considered the true source of the extension.

## This Project Contains

- new shading language extension proposals and discussions
- issue tracking for these unreleased extensions
