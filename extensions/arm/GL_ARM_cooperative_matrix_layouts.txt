Dependencies
    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
    (#version 140) and higher.
    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.0
    (#version 300) and higher.
    This extension is written against revision 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.50, dated May 9, 2017.
    This extension interacts with revision 2 of the GL_KHR_cooperative_matrix.
    extension, dated 03 May 2023.

Overview
    This extension adds support for cooperative matrix memory layouts used on Arm GPUs.
    The new layouts are described in GLSL using the constants

        gl_CooperativeMatrixLayoutRowBlockedInterleavedARM = 4202
        gl_CooperativeMatrixLayoutColumnBlockedInterleavedARM = 4203

    These constants match their equivalent on the accompanying SPIR-V extension.
    The layout requires the user provided buffers for the cooperative matrix data
    contain the matrix data laid out as described in the equivalent SPIR-V extension
    SPV_ARM_cooperative_matrix_layouts.

Issues
    None.
