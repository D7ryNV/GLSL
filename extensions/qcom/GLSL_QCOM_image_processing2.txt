Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
    (#version 140) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
    (#version 310) and higher.

    Requires GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.

    Requires GL_QCOM_image_processing.


Overview

    This extension is a follow-on to an earlier extension GL_QCOM_image_processing which has
    added four new shader instructions to perform some of the frequently sought image
    processing tasks. This extension adds another four new image processing operations.

    Block Matching Window SSD: The operation repeatedly performs block match operations
      across a 2D window specified on the sampler used to create the target image to
      compute an error at each (X,Y) within the 2D window that describes whether the texel
      in the target image matches the corresponding texel in the reference image and
      return either the minimum or maximum error using sum of squares (SSD) of the differences. 
  
    Block Matching Window SAD: This operation follows the same pattern as "Block Matching
      Window SSD", computing the sum of the absolute differences (SAD)

    Block Matching Gather SSD: The operation computes errors at 4 texels at the given offsets
      that describe whether the texels in the target image match the corresponding texels in 
      the reference image. It returns the SSD error metrics at the 4 texel offsets in the X, Y, 
      Z, and W components. 

    Block Matching Gather SAD: This operation follows the same pattern as "Block Matching
     Gather SSD", computing the sum of the absolute differences at 4 offsets.

    Each of the above 4 image processing operations are limited to single-component formats.


Modifications to the OpenGL GL Shading Language Specification, Version 1.40, dated 22 November 2009

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_QCOM_image_processing2  : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in Section 3.3.

    A new preprocessor #define is added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_QCOM_image_processing2    1

    Add to the table at the end of Subsection 8.9.2 "Texel Lookup Functions"
    the following image processing functions. Note that these built-ins rely on separate
    samplers and textures as defined in GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.
