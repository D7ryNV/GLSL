    TBD.

Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
    (#version 140) and higher.

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
    (#version 310) and higher.

    Requires GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.

Overview

    This extension allows passing texture objects directly to texture query
    and lookup functions that do not require a sampler.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.50

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_EXT_samplerless_texture_functions : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_EXT_samplerless_texture_functions     1

    Change the first paragraph of section "8.9 Texture Functions" from:

        "Texture lookup functions are available in all shading stages.
        However, automatic level of detail is computed only for fragment
        shaders. Other shaders operate as though the base level of detail
        were computed as zero. The functions in the table below provide
        access to textures through samplers, ..."

    to:

        "Texture lookup functions are available in all shading stages.
        However, automatic level of detail is computed only for fragment
        shaders. Other shaders operate as though the base level of detail
        were computed as zero. The functions in the table below provide
        access to textures directly and through samplers, ..."

    Change the third paragraph from:

        "Texture lookup functions are provided that can return their result
        as floating point, unsigned integer or signed integer, depending on
        the sampler type passed to the lookup function."

    to:

        "Texture lookup functions are provided that can return their result
        as floating point, unsigned integer or signed integer, depending on
        the texture or sampler type passed to the lookup function."

    Change the first paragraph of subsection "8.9.1 Texture Query Functions"
    from:

        "The textureSize functions query the dimensions of a specific
        texture level for a sampler"

    to:

        "The textureSize functions query the dimensions of a specific
        texture level for a texture or sampler"

    Add to the table at the end of subsection 8.9.1 the following functions:

        int textureSize (gtexture1D texture, int lod)
        ivec2 textureSize (gtexture2D texture, int lod)
        ivec3 textureSize (gtexture3D texture, int lod)
        ivec2 textureSize (gtextureCube texture, int lod)
        ivec3 textureSize (gtextureCubeArray texture, int lod)
        ivec2 textureSize (gtexture2DRect texture)
        ivec2 textureSize (gtexture1DArray texture, int lod)
        ivec3 textureSize (gtexture2DArray texture, int lod)
        int textureSize (gtextureBuffer texture)
        ivec2 textureSize (gtexture2DMS texture)
        ivec3 textureSize (gtexture2DMSArray texture)

        int textureQueryLevels(gtexture1D texture)
        int textureQueryLevels(gtexture2D texture)
        int textureQueryLevels(gtexture3D texture)
        int textureQueryLevels(gtextureCube texture)
        int textureQueryLevels(gtexture1DArray texture)
        int textureQueryLevels(gtexture2DArray texture)
        int textureQueryLevels(gtextureCubeArray texture)

        int textureSamples(gtexture2DMS texture)
        int textureSamples(gtexture2DMSArray texture)

    Add to the table in subsection "8.9.2 Texel Lookup Functions" the
    following functions:

        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture1D texture, int P, int lod)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture2D texture, ivec2 P, int lod)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture3D texture, ivec3 P, int lod)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture2DRect texture, ivec2 P)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture1DArray texture, ivec2 P, int lod)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture2DArray texture, ivec3 P, int lod)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtextureBuffer texture, int P)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture2DMS texture, ivec2 P, int sample)
        gvec4 texelFetch (gtexture2DMSArray texture, ivec3 P,
                          int sample)

        gvec4 texelFetchOffset (gtexture1D texture, int P, int lod,
                                int offset)
        gvec4 texelFetchOffset (gtexture2D texture, ivec2 P, int lod,
                                ivec2 offset)
        gvec4 texelFetchOffset (gtexture3D texture, ivec3 P, int lod,
                                ivec3 offset)
        gvec4 texelFetchOffset (gtexture2DRect texture, ivec2 P,
                                ivec2 offset)
        gvec4 texelFetchOffset (gtexture1DArray texture, ivec2 P, int lod,
                                int offset)
        gvec4 texelFetchOffset (gtexture2DArray texture, ivec3 P, int lod,
                                ivec2 offset)
