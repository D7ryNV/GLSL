  TBD.

Dependencies

  This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 1.40
  (#version 140) and higher.

  This extension can be applied to OpenGL ES ESSL versions 3.10
  (#version 310) and higher.

  This extension is written against the OpenGL Shading Language
  Specification, version 4.60 (revision 7), dated July 10, 2019.

  Interacts with GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl.

  Interacts with GL_EXT_control_flow_attributes.

Overview

  This extension adds the ability to annotate entry points via an attribute to
  indicate that invocations should reconverge in the same manner indicated in
  the source shader.

  This is done through the attribute syntax "[[ ... ]]" syntax. For example,
    
    void main() [[maximally_reconverges]] { ...  }

Modifications to GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl

  Add to the "Mapping to SPIR-V" section:

  [[maximally_reconverges]] maps to the MaximallyReconvergesKHR
  execution mode on the entry point where the attribute is specified.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60 (revision 7)

  Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
  language features described in this extension:

    #extension GL_EXT_maximal_reconvergence : <behavior>

  where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

  New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

    #define GL_EXT_maximal_reconvergence     1

  In Section 6.1 Function Definitions, add the paragraph:

    The "maximally_reconverges" attribute can be added to an entry
    point definition by including the attribute between the function prototype
    and the function body.

  In Chapter 9 Shading Language Grammar:

  Change the definition of function_prototype to:

    function_prototype:
      function_declarator RIGHT_PAREN
      function_declarator RIGHT_PAREN attribute
      attribute function_declarator RIGHT_PAREN
      attribute function_declarator RIGHT_PAREN attribute

  Add:

    attribute:
      LEFT_BRACKET LEFT_BRACKET attribute_list RIGHT_BRACKET RIGHT_BRACKET

    attribute_list:
      single_attribute
      attribute_list COMMA single_attribute

    single_attribute:
      IDENTIFIER
      IDENTIFIER LEFT_PAREN constant_expression RIGHT_PAREN
