Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.60
    (#version 460) and higher.

    This extension is written against revision 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated July 10, 2019.

    This extension interacts with revision 43 of the GL_KHR_vulkan_glsl
    extension, dated October 25, 2017.

Overview

    This extension allows a subpass shading shader to delcare subpass inputs and use subpass input functions.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_HUAWEI_subpass_shading                          : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added:

      #define GL_HUAWEI_subpass_shading  

Changes to Chapter 4 of The OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Modify Section 4.1.7, (Opaque Types)

    Change the "Subpass-input types are only available in fragment shaders." to 

    Subpass-input types are only available in fragment and subpass shading shaders.

Changes to Chapter 8 of The OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Modify Section 8.18, (Subpass-Input Functions)

    Change the "Subpass-input functions are only available when targeting a Vulkan fragment stage." to 

    Subpass-input functions are only available when targeting a Vulkan fragment and subpass shading stage.

Changes to Chapter 12 of The OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Modify Section 12.2.4, (Vulkan Only: Samplers, Images, Textures, and Buffers)

    Change the "Subpass inputs are read through a new set of types, available only to fragment shaders:" to 

    Subpass inputs are read through a new set of types, available only to fragment and subpass shading shaders:
